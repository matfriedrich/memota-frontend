# MemotaFrontend
Angular web application for showcasing IOTA cryptocurrency. This is still in development and doesn't do much yet. 

At the moment, all it does is connect to a websocket of the memota-backend project and show an alert when a new transaction 
on the seed used in the backend is found. 

The backend project can be found here: https://github.com/matfriedrich/memota-backend .

This readme will be updated as development progresses.
